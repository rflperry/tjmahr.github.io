In a phrase: Speech pathologist turned data scientist. 

I am a Ph.D. student in communication sciences and disorders in Madison, 
Wisconsin. On paper, I study word recognition and word learning in preschoolers,
but over the course of my graduate training, I discovered that I really, really 
like programming and working with data. I get endless satisfaction from making 
computers do things and from solving technical problems. Functional programming makes
me feel like a literal wizard. I love sharing my enthusiasm with others: Sitting
down with a colleague and their dataset and coaching them through ways to
analyze their data in R. Nothing feels better than giving someone that moment of
feeling like a wizard.

Here are some things I might write about here:

* R
* Functional programming
* Bayesian statistics
* Reproducible computing
* Neural networks
* How to plot certain kinds of data
* Whatever other little thing I have learned to do recently

I have consulted on generalized mixed-effects regression models. I fit models
and visualize data from psychology experiments. I deliver reproducible analyses
with tutorials/commentary on the analysis steps and code.
